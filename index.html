    <h1>Overview my GitHub repos.</h1>

        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/r-statistics">TA class in Statistics</a>
        <p>The static website is <a href="https://hochia.github.io/r-statistics/">here</a>. Most of the content I followed <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. I reorganized the concepts which students need to know to handle their homeworks. Due to limited time, some of the features are not included or explained in detail.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/web">Study web development</a>
        <p>Since I use Shiny, which is an R package to build interactive web apps, to make a presentation in class, I had spent some time studying web development. HTML and CSS is the most part that I put into practice, while JavaScript is somewhat complicated for me to study. Besides, I took a chance to design a <a href="http://www.stat.ntu.edu.tw/chinese/2021statweek_paperaward.html">webpage</a> for my department.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/orientchessr">Early study of R package development</a>
        <p>This is where I kicked off R package development. <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R Packages</a> really helps a lot to get into the ideas. Meanwhile, I wrote a <a href="https://bookdown.org/Hochia/orientchessr/">book</a> through <a href="https://bookdown.org/">bookdown</a> to introduce how to use this package and <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/oc-bkd">here</a> is the original content of the book. The package is not well-developed, in case you want to use it.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/soothe">Utilize R to run PowerShell</a>
        <p><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/about.html">FFmpeg</a> is helpful to deal with multimedia files. After installing and setting up FFmpeg, users can run code in PowerShell to take advantage of it. However, it is quite sophisticated to cope with a real-world problem instantly. Therefore, it is suitable to select and order the candidate files in R and this package generate code and call PowerShell to run it.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/ml-final">Machine learning final project</a>
        <p>I work with Boru and Ray Lu to complete this final project. Contents in folder <i>Ray Lu</i> and <i>boru</i> are a part of their contributes. We study Convolutional neural network (CNN) to implement the system for marketing. Note that README is not completed and PowerPoint is not open. However, presentation can be viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aQkgOd8F34&ab_channel=OALab">YouTube</a>.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/108-1-py-final">Python class final project</a>
        <p><a href="https://hochia.github.io/108-1-py-final/index.html">This</a> is the website I built for presentation. Worked with a exchange student from China to complete the study of Convolutional neural network (CNN), I was inspired by him a lot and this is my first time learing CNN. We also spent some time discussing an awesome package <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan">xaringan</a> in r.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Hochia/portfolio">Portfolio</a>
